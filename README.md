Frontend Developer Test
by Russell Wong @ 2019 Sept

We are going to create a better UI/UX for notification systems in our product Remo Conference. In this test, we want you to design and develop notifications (both in-app and push notification) for the following situations.

1. Notify a user when another user join a table
2. Notify a user when another user leave a table
3. Notify a user when broadcast start
4. Notify a user when broadcast end
5. Notify a user when he has connection issue
6. Notify a user when other has connection issue
7. Notify a user when he has webcam issue
8. Notify a user when other has webcam issue

Please use the remo-conference.png image as backend to add your notify component in.
